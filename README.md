# ESDETR
This is the official implement of ES-DETR, ES-DETR: Real-time Detection Transformer with Encover and Soft-Dropout.

We provide pretrained models for various configurations of ES-DETR. ES-DETR is an innovative object detection framework that builds upon the strengths of DETR (Detection Transformer) while addressing its limitations. 

You can find the pretrained in release file: https://github.com/he13689/ESDETR/releases/tag/weights.
